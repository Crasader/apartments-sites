  Apartment owners carry insurance, but only on THEIR property.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="bold">Why Should You Have It?</span><br />
  You would feel just as empty and angry as a homeowner if you arrived home and found you had been burglarized. Most homeowners have insurance coverage... why not renters? All of the possessions you treasure are just as important to protect in your apartment home.<br />
  <br />
			The most widespread misconception of renters is that properly damage by fire, windstorm or hail, explosion, smoke, vehicles, vandalism, falling objects, electrical/plumbing/air conditioning or heating mishaps, rain, snow, ice or sleet is covered by their landlord's policy.<br />
      <br />
			Apartment owners carry insurance on their buildings and their properly within the building or rental unit, but not on damaged properly belonging to residents.<br />
      <br />
			Have you thought about the risk of a lawsuit or medical expenses for personal injury if guests are injured in your apartment2 Or if you become involved in a liability claim from your outside sports activities, or from your child with a wild baseball bat in a neighborhood game, or even from pets?<br />
      <br />
			Renter's insurance is relatively low cost and one of the wisest purchases an apartment resident can make.<br />
      <br />
			You may not realize what your belongings are worth until you make an inventory and start adding things up. We recommend that you contact an agent for your own protection and peace of mind. Renter's insurance...it's one of the smartest investments you can make!
